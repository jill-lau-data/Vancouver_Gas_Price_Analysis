# â›½ Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Project

## Overview
The **Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Project** aims to collect and analyze gas prices in Greater Vancouver to identify cost-saving opportunities for residents, such as determining the cheapest times to buy gas in Richmond, BC. The project consists of two main components:

- **Google Apps Script Gas Price Fetcher**: A script that collects gas prices from GasBuddy.com for 18 locations in Greater Vancouver and stores them in a Google Sheet. See the [fetcher/](fetcher/) directory for details.
- **Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the collected data to uncover patterns, such as temporal price trends, using Python, pandas, and statistical methods like ANOVA. See the [analysis/](analysis/) directory for details.

This project showcases skills in data collection, automation, and analysis, with applications for both residents and businesses (e.g., optimizing fuel purchasing strategies).
