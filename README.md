# ⛽ Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Project 🚗💨

## Hey There! Let’s Talk Gas Prices! 🗣️   
Have you ever heard that gas prices in some spots around Greater Vancouver (not counting Abbotsford) can be a total steal? 🌟 I sure have—my friends always say Richmond’s got the cheapest gas at night, especially after we’ve had a great dinner together. They’ll swing by, fill up their tanks, and save a few bucks! But is that just a lucky coincidence, or is there something to it? 🤔 That’s exactly why I started this **Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Project**—to dig into the data, prove it’s not just a random trick, and help us all find the best times and places to fuel up. Let’s save some cash together! 💸

## What’s This Project About? 📊  
This project is all about figuring out where and when gas prices are lowest in Greater Vancouver, so you can save money next time you’re at the pump. I focused on places like Richmond, Vancouver, and Port Moody, and here’s how I did it:  
- **Google Apps Script Gas Price Fetcher**: I built a little script that grabs gas prices from GasBuddy.com for 18 stations across Greater Vancouver and saves them in a Google Sheet. It’s like having a friend who’s always checking prices for you! Check out the [fetcher/](fetcher/) folder for more.  
- **Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Notebook**: Then, I used a Jupyter Notebook to dive into the data with Python, pandas, and some stats (like ANOVA) to spot patterns—like whether Richmond really is cheaper at night. You’ll find all the details in the [analysis/](analysis/) folder.  

This project isn’t just for me—it’s for anyone who wants to save on gas, whether you’re a local or running a business trying to keep fuel costs down. 🤑
