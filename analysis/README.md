# 📊 Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Notebook 🚗💨  

## What’s Cooking Here? 🍳  
Hey there! This is the **Vancouver Gas Price Analysis Notebook**—where I take all those gas prices collected by my trusty fetcher and turn them into something exciting! 🌟 My mission? To figure out if Richmond really does have cheaper gas at night, like my friends swear by after our dinner hangouts. Using Python, pandas, and a bit of stats magic (like ANOVA), I dig into the data to spot patterns and prove it’s not just luck. Ready to see if we can save some cash at the pump? Let’s dive in! 💸  

## How to Get Started? 🛠️  
1. **Grab the Data**: Make sure you’ve run the [Google Apps Script Gas Price Fetcher](https://github.com/jill-lau-data/vancouver_gas_price/blob/main/fetcher/README.md) to get your gas price data into a Google Sheet. Export it as a CSV and save it somewhere handy.  
2. **Set Up Python**: Install the tools you need—check out the `requirements.txt` file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal. It’s like prepping your kitchen before cooking! 🍲  
3. **Open the Notebook**: Fire up Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) and open `Vancouver Gas Price Analysis.ipynb`.  
4. **Run the Code**: Follow the steps in the notebook—load your data, play with the charts, and see what pops up!  
5. **Explore the Findings**: Check if Richmond’s night prices (maybe around 149.8 cents/liter at 11 PM!) beat the rest. Let me know what you think! 😄  

## What’s Inside? 📋  
- `Vancouver Gas Price Analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook where I crunch the numbers and create those awesome charts.  
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python goodies (like pandas and seaborn) you’ll need to run it.  
- `README.md`: You’re reading it—this guide to get you going!  

## A Little Heads-Up 🎉  
This notebook is all about having fun with data, but it’s built on the gas prices from 18 stations I picked (more on that in [fetcher/README.md](https://github.com/jill-lau-data/vancouver_gas_price/blob/main/fetcher/README.md)). If you want to tweak it or add your own stations, go for it—just update the data and rerun!
